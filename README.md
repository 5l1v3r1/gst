## üì¶ How to get GST
### Install from Flathub
This is the preferred way to get GST on any major distribution (Arch, Fedora, Linux Mint, openSUSE, Ubuntu, etc).

If you don't have Flatpak installed you can find step by step instructions [here](https://flatpak.org/setup/).

Make sure to have the Flathub remote added to the current user:

```bash
flatpak --user remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
```

#### Install
```bash
flatpak --user install flathub com.leinardi.gst
```

#### Run
```bash
flatpak run com.leinardi.gst
```
### Distro specific packages
#### Arch Linux
Install the `gst` package from the AUR using your favourite helper, for example `yay -S gst`.

#### Fedora
[COPR package](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/atim/gst/): `sudo dnf copr enable atim/gst -y && sudo dnf install gst`


### Install from source code
#### Dependencies for (K/X)Ubuntu 18.10 or newer
```bash
sudo apt install appstream-util gir1.2-gtksource-3.0 git libcairo2-dev libgirepository1.0-dev libglib2.0-dev meson python3-gi-cairo python3-pip stress-ng
```

#### Dependencies for Fedora 28 or newer
```bash
dnf install desktop-file-utils git gobject-introspection-devel gtk3-devel libappstream-glib meson python3-cairocffi python3-devel python3-pip redhat-rpm-config stress-ng
```

#### Clone project and install
If you have not installed GST yet:
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules -j4 https://gitlab.com/leinardi/gst.git
cd gst
git checkout release
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
meson . build --prefix /usr
ninja -v -C build
ninja -v -C build install
```

#### Update old installation
If you installed GST from source code previously and you want to update it:
```bash
cd gst
git fetch
git checkout release
git reset --hard origin/release
git submodule init
git submodule update
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
meson . build --prefix /usr
ninja -v -C build
ninja -v -C build install
```

#### Run
Once installed, to start it you can simply execute on a terminal:
```bash
gst
```

## üñ•Ô∏è Build, install and run with Flatpak
If you don't have Flatpak installed you can find step by step instructions [here](https://flatpak.org/setup/).

Make sure to have the Flathub remote added to the current user:

```bash
flatpak --user remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
```

### Clone the repo
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules -j4 https://gitlab.com/leinardi/gst.git
```
It is possible to build the local source or the remote one (the same that Flathub uses)
### Local repository
```bash
./build.sh --flatpak-local --flatpak-install
```
### Remote repository
```bash
./build.sh --flatpak-remote --flatpak-install
```
### Run
```bash
flatpak run com.leinardi.gst --debug
```

## üñ•Ô∏è How to build and run the source code
If you want to clone the project and run directly from the source you need to manually install all the needed
dependencies.
 
### (K/X)Ubuntu 18.04 or newer
See [Install from source](https://gitlab.com/leinardi/gst#kxubuntu-1810-or-newer-dependencies)

### Python dependencies

## ‚ùì FAQ

### Where are the settings and profiles stored on the filesystem?
| Installation type |                     Location                     |
|-------------------|:------------------------------------------------:|
| Flatpak           |        `$HOME/.var/app/com.leinardi.gst/`        |
| Source code       | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` (usually `$HOME/.config/gst`) |

## üíö How to help the project
### Discord server
If you want to help testing or developing it would be easier to get in touch using the discord server of the project: https://discord.gg/YjPdNff  
Just write a message on the general channel saying how you want to help (test, dev, etc) and quoting @leinardi. If you don't use discor but still want to help just open a new issue here.


### Can I support this project some other way?

Something simple that everyone can do is to star it on both [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/leinardi/gst) and [GitHub](https://github.com/leinardi/gst).
Feedback is always welcome: if you found a bug or would like to suggest a feature,
feel free to open an issue on the [issue tracker](https://gitlab.com/leinardi/gst/issues).
